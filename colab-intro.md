# Introduction to Colaboratory

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free Jupyter notebook
environment that runs entirely in the cloud. Thanks to Google, they released
computing resources such as GPU and TPU for beginners to study Deep Learning.

In this module, we tend to use this tool for demonstration and accelerating
training. To run code in Colaboratory, you will need a valid Google account.

## Suggested Paradigm for using Colaboratory

In the real world, Python developers rarely use Jupyter notebook to develop their own package/scripts. And it is hard for the notebook to be run in a cluster, remote machines or compact devices such as Raspberry Pi.
Therefore, we suggest that you write a script, upload to the Colaboratory, and run in the cloud.

With the shell integration in Colaboratory, it's actually easier than you think, please check out [this Colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14dnEMLJhZ8s52V9ayahZKFOZ6HwzvXy3).

You can simply clone this to your Google Drive and experiment there!
