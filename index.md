This module instructs students on the basics of deep learning as well as building better and faster deep network classifiers for sensor data. The module is strongly project-based, with two main phases. In the first phase, students will learn the basics of deep learning and Computer Vision, e.g. stochastic gradient descent, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, filtering, and corner detection. At the end of this first phase, students should be ready to run simple networks in TensorFlow and implement basic computer vision methods in Python. In the second phase, students will be divided into teams of 2 or 3. Each team will tackle a problem of their choosing, from fields such as computer vision, pattern recognition, distributed computing. Example projects include face recognition and emotion recognition.

# Projects

+ __Baby Jarvis__: Implement a face recognition system using Keras, OpenCV, and Raspberry Pi. The device will voice the name of the face it sees. (Difficulty: 5)

+ __Baby Jarvis II__: Distinguish between happy and sad faces using Keras, OpenCV and Raspberry Pi. (Difficulty: 5)

+ __Baby Jarvis III__: Proof-of-concept driver monitoring system by detecting if the user is sleeping, checking the phone or doing other reckless activities while driving. (Difficulty: 6)

+ __Are You Human?__: Break a CAPTCHA that uses simple math as the question. (Difficulty: 6)

+ __Which station is this?__: Take a picture of the station name, recognize the
station and find the position from Google Maps! (Difficulty: 7)

+ __Implementing backpropagation__: Implement the backpropagation method in basic python without relying on any high level APIs like Keras or Tensorflow. (Difficulty: 7)

+ __(Advanced) Paper Piano__: Print the piano key on a paper, use CV techniques to identify which key is pressed and play the sound. (Difficulty: 8)

+ __(Advanced) Raspberry that talks__: Analyse an image via image captioning, then broadcast the information to a speaker. (Difficulty: 8)

+ __(Advanced) Object Tracking__: Develop a model-free object tracker for [VOT Challenge](http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2017/index.html)! (Difficulty: 9)

+ __(Advanced) Real-world Image Classification__: Develop a classifier for [TinyImageNet](https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/) using state-of-the-art Deep Networks and run it as fast as you can on Raspberry Pi! (Difficulty: 9)

+ Or... your ideas!

__Remark__: Difficulty scale: 1 (so easy) -- 10 (way too hard)

__Remark__: First-come-First-serve basis in selecting project.
