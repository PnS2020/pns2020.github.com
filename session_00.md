this module. Check out the __Technical Tutorials and Resources__ for
further readings.

## Grouping

Each team will have either two or three students.

## GitHub

In this module, we manage all the resources and projects in an GitHub Organization:

---
<div>
<h3 align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/PnS2019">https://github.com/PnS2020</a>
</h3>
</div>
---

Therefore, an GitHub account is essential. If you don't have one, please
go to https://github.com/ and register an new account. After registration,
please submit your username to the TA.
