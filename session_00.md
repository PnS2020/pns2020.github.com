# Setup

In this tutorial, you should follow the steps to setup your machine for
this module. Check out the __Technical Tutorials and Resources__ for
further readings.

## Grouping

Each team will have either two or three students.

## GitHub

In this module, we manage all the resources and projects in an GitHub Organization:

---
<div>
<h3 align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/PnS2019">https://github.com/PnS2020</a>
</h3>
</div>
---

Therefore, an GitHub account is essential. If you don't have one, please
go to https://github.com/ and register an new account. After registration,
please submit your username to the TA so we can add you into the organization.

To get additional paid features, you can get the GitHub Education Pack: https://education.github.com/pack
